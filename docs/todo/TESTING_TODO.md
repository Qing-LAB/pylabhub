## Current Focus

### Open: Review-deferred items from the test-framework sweep

Items surfaced by the static review before Lua chunk 4 (see commit
`e7f0296` message body for the full review diagnosis). Deferred so
each chunk commit stays a focused refactor+review-and-augment pass
with no structural-cleanup mixed in.

**Policy — delete V2 duplicates in the same commit that lands their P3
replacement** (not at sweep-end).  Rationale: test-registry names
`LuaEngineTest.X` and `LuaEngineIsolatedTest.X` coexist without GTest
complaining, so deferred deletion silently runs duplicate coverage
and confuses later coverage/triage reviews.  **Established
2026-04-19 during chunk-6a cleanup.**

- [x] ~~Rename `LuaEngineIsolatedTest` fixture~~ — **done 2026-04-19** in
  the pre-chunk-6 rename commit. Renamed to `LuaEngineIsolatedTest`;
  all 30 tests across chunks 1-5 and the two in-file doc-banner
  references updated.

- [ ] Delete the V2 `LuaEngineTest` fixture WRAPPER (class body,
  helpers `setup_engine`, `make_api`, `write_script`, and now-unused
  includes `<atomic>`, `<unistd.h>`, `test_patterns.h`) when the
  LAST V2 test inside it is converted. Chunk 6a cleanup
  **2026-04-19** deleted 7 duplicate V2 tests (ApiStop, ApiSetCrit,
  ApiStopReason_Default, Api_CriticalError_Default,
  ApiStopReason_ReflectsPeerDead, ApiStopReason_AfterCriticalError,
  Api_IdentityFields_MatchContext) — the fixture still holds the
  remaining ~65 unconverted V2 tests and stays for later chunks.

**Deferred until both Lua + Python engine conversions complete**:

- [ ] Unify the worker-side `produce_worker_with_script` /
  `consume_worker_with_script` / `process_worker_with_script`
  helper templates. They share ~70% logic today (different required
  callback + different slot-type name + different role tag). A
  single `script_worker(scenario_name, required_cb, tag, slot_regs,
  lua_src, body)` helper would fold all three. Wait until after
  Python (which has an analogous trio) so the helper can be shared
  across both engine test files if that proves sensible. Files:
  `workers/lua_engine_workers.cpp`, `workers/python_engine_workers.cpp`.

**Coverage gaps from the review** (add in whichever chunk touches
the same area, or a dedicated "error-paths" chunk after the
callback chunks):

- [ ] **Test: `invoke_consume` returning Discard** (Lua `return false`).
  Chunks 3 covers Commit (return true) and Error (error() call), but
  not the Discard path. invoke_consume's return-value dispatch for
  false → Discard is currently unverified. Drop into a later chunk
  or add to chunk 3's scope (probably not worth reopening chunk 3).

- [x] ~~Tests: `engine.load_script` error paths~~ — **done 2026-04-20**
  in chunk 7b.  Three P3 tests landed (missing file, missing required
  callback, syntax error).  Each strengthened with "engine is
  reusable after failure" retry.  Same gap still open for Python;
  convert alongside Python chunk 7b.

- [x] ~~Test: `engine.finalize()` idempotence~~ — **done 2026-04-20**
  in chunk 7b.  P3 test `Finalize_DoubleCallIsSafe` pins:
  double-finalize is a no-op (no crash, no throw), post-finalize
  `is_accepting()` returns false, and post-finalize invoke returns
  `InvokeResult::Error` (not a crash).

- [ ] **Test: `RegisterSlotType_CustomName_NotReadOnlyByDefault`**
  (from the post-chunk-5 review, assumption A1 in the read-only
  mechanism investigation). `register_slot_type` in
  `src/scripting/lua_engine.cpp:697-717` dispatches by EXACT name:
  only "InSlotFrame" and "InboxFrame" get `readonly=true` in the
  cached ffi ctype; "OutSlotFrame" / "InFlexFrame" / "OutFlexFrame"
  get `readonly=false`; any other name falls through without caching
  into either ref.  A test that registers under a custom name and
  attempts a Lua write should verify either:
    - the write succeeds (no `const*` protection by default), OR
    - the engine logs a clear diagnostic about the unknown type.
  Pin whichever behaviour is the current implementation so a
  regression that accidentally grants/denies const protection to
  custom names would fail the test.

- [ ] **Test: rx-write-in-invoke_on_inbox (same mechanism, separate
  code path)**. Chunk 3 covers invoke_consume, chunk 4 covers
  invoke_process. `invoke_on_inbox` (lua_engine.cpp:992) also pushes
  a read-only frame (`ref_inbox_readonly_`, :715). Same loud-failure
  contract should apply; test needs to be added when inbox coverage
  lands (chunk 7 or later).

**Cross-cutting cleanup deferred to end of entire L2 sweep**:

- [ ] Trim redundant `GTest::gmock` link additions from L2 CMake
  targets where the parent file doesn't reference `::testing::`.
  Added defensively in several sweep commits; harmless but
  inconsistent. One focused commit at sweep-end to grep parents and
  trim deps that aren't used.

- [ ] Grep for stale test-name references across the repo (CI
  scripts, dashboards, docs) in case a sweep commit renamed a test
  that is filtered for by name in some external script. Candidates
  known to be renamed so far:
  - `LuaEngineTest.InitializeFailsGracefully` →
    `LuaEngineIsolatedTest.InitializeAndFinalize_Succeeds`
  - `LuaEngineTest.RegisterSlotType_PackedPacking` →
    `LuaEngineIsolatedTest.RegisterSlotType_Packed_vs_Aligned`
  - `LuaEngineTest.InvokeConsume_ReceivesReadOnlySlot` →
    `LuaEngineIsolatedTest.InvokeConsume_ReceivesSlot`
  - `LuaEngineTest.InvokeProcess_NilInput` →
    `LuaEngineIsolatedTest.InvokeProcess_BothSlotsNil`
  - `LuaEngineTest.InvokeProcess_InputOnlyNoOutput` →
    `LuaEngineIsolatedTest.InvokeProcess_RxPresent_TxNil`

- [ ] Final audit re-grep: after all L2+L3 conversions land, re-run
  the original grep from `docs/tech_draft/test_compliance_audit.md`
  across every `tests/test_layer*/test_*.cpp` to confirm no stale
  V1/V2 patterns remain and no new ones were introduced during the
  sweep timeframe.

### Open: Stress-level calibration across converted Pattern-3 tests

The test framework already exposes `STRESS_TEST_LEVEL` (via
`shared_test_helpers.h`: `get_stress_num_threads()`,
`get_stress_num_writers()`, `get_stress_num_readers()`,
`get_stress_duration_sec()`, `get_stress_iterations(high, low)`).
Several race-hunting tests converted in the test-framework sweep
kept the originals' hardcoded thread/iter counts instead of
adopting the helpers, so CI defaults run hotter than Low-stress
values and developers running `-DSTRESS_TEST_LEVEL=High` don't get
the amplification the helpers would provide.

Deferred here (not in the converting-sweep commits) so each
sweep commit stays a pure refactor with no semantic change.

Affected tests that should adopt the helpers:

| File | Test | Current | Should be |
|---|---|---|---|
| `workers/filelock_singleprocess_workers.cpp` | `multi_threaded_contention` | `kThreads = 10` | `get_stress_num_threads()` |
| `workers/role_config_workers.cpp` | `multi_thread_file_contention` | 16 threads × 25 iters | `get_stress_num_threads()`, `get_stress_iterations(25, 8)` |
| `workers/role_config_workers.cpp` | `multi_thread_shared_object_contention` | 4 writers + 8 readers × 1s duration | `get_stress_num_writers()`, `get_stress_num_readers()`, duration scaled from `get_stress_duration_sec()` (divide by a constant to keep sub-second at Low) |
| `test_filelock.cpp` | `MultiProcessBlockingContention` | 8 procs × 100 iters | `get_stress_num_threads()` capped at a hard max (process count has real IPC overhead), `get_stress_iterations(100, 25)` |

When done: run `ctest -j2 --repeat until-pass:3 -L layer2` at
each stress level (Low / Medium / High) to confirm no new flakes.

### Phase C: Integration Tests
**Status**: ✅ Complete (424/424 as of 2026-02-19; suite grown to **1181/1181** by 2026-03-30)

- [x] **MessageHub and broker tests** – Phase C broker integration + consumer registration complete
- [x] **Multi-process IPC tests** – Producer/consumer across process boundaries (E2E test)
- [x] **hub::Producer + hub::Consumer active API** – 15 tests; HELLO/BYE tracking, SHM callbacks, ctrl messaging, idempotency, destructor-BYE regression
- [ ] **Cross-platform consistency** – Run same tests on Linux (done), Windows, macOS, FreeBSD

### New Gaps Discovered (2026-03-30)

- [ ] **ZMQ checksum policy execution tests** — ZmqQueue now supports `set_checksum_policy()` with compute + verify paths, but no L3 tests exercise the ZMQ-specific checksum compute/verify logic (only SHM checksum paths have coverage). Need: write with enforced checksum → read with verify → confirm match; write corrupted → read with verify → confirm `checksum_error_count` increments.
- [ ] **Config key whitelist edge case tests** — Config parser now rejects unknown JSON keys, but edge cases need coverage: empty object `{}`, keys with Unicode, keys that are prefixes of valid keys (e.g. `"script_"` vs `"script"`), nested unknown keys inside known objects.

### Schema/Packing Round-Trip Coverage Gap (2026-04-16)

- [ ] **L3 gap: No aligned-packing round-trip with padding-sensitive schema** — Existing ZmqQueue tests use packed packing for mixed-type round-trip (`Schema_MixedArrayFields_MultipleTypes_Roundtrip`) and aligned for simple schemas. No test verifies data correctness through padding gaps (e.g., `{bool, int32, float64}` aligned: padding after bool and after int32 must not corrupt adjacent field data). Need: write complex schema with aligned packing → read back → verify every field bit-exact across padding boundaries.
- [ ] **L3 gap: No SHM round-trip with complex schema** — SHM tests use blob schemas only. Need SHM round-trip with multi-field schema (both aligned and packed) to verify `compute_field_layout` → DataBlock → read-back integrity.
- [ ] **L3 gap: No aligned-vs-packed same-data comparison** — Write identical logical data through both packing modes, verify both produce correct field values despite different physical layouts.

### BrokerProtocolTest Timing Audit (2026-03-23)
- [ ] BrokerProtocolTest suite passes but execution times cluster near typical timeout values (~2s). Risk: tests could be masking timing-dependent failures by passing on timeout rather than on correct event sequence. Audit should verify each test validates actual event logs and message ordering, not just return codes or "didn't hang" outcomes.

### Phase D: High-Load and Edge Cases
**Status**: 🔵 Partial — RAII stress tests added; extended/platform tests deferred

- [x] **RAII multi-process ring-buffer stress** — `DatahubStressRaiiTest` (tests 423–424):
  - `MultiProcessFullCapacityStress`: 500 × 4KB slots, ring=32 (15 wraparounds), 2 racing consumers,
    enforced BLAKE2b + app-level XOR-fold, random 0–5ms write / 0–10ms read delays
  - `SingleReaderBackpressure`: 100 slots, ring=8, consumer 0–20ms delays force producer to block
- [ ] **High-load extended stress** – Hours-long soak tests; multiple producers simultaneously
- [ ] **Edge case scenarios** – Wraparound at 2^64, slot_id rollover, capacity exhaustion
- [ ] **Broker-coordinated recovery** – Cross-process zombie detection (blocked on broker protocol extension)
- [ ] **Slot-checksum in-place repair** – Blocked: existing repair reinitialises header; needs WriteAttach approach

### Code Review REVIEW_FullStack_2026-03-17 — Testing gaps

- [ ] **PARITY-01 HIGH: No Lua role integration tests** — LuaProducerHost, LuaConsumerHost,
  LuaProcessorHost data loops, inbox drain, and startup coordination have zero integration test
  coverage. Need `test_lua_producer_roundtrip`, `test_lua_consumer_roundtrip`,
  `test_lua_processor_roundtrip` in test_layer4_*.
- [ ] **L0 gap: No `uuid_utils` unit tests** — `generate_uuid4()` has no L0 test.
- [ ] **L0 gap: No `bytes_to_hex`/`bytes_from_hex` tests** — Used in ZMQ identity encoding.
- [ ] **L2 gap: ZMQ context tests minimal** (88 lines) — No concurrent start/stop, no double-start.
- [ ] **L2 gap: No DataBlockMutex WAIT_ABANDONED test** for Windows robust mutex path.
- [ ] **L2 gap: No vault corruption detection test** — truncated file, bit-flip in ciphertext.

### Watchlist: ShmQueueWriteFlexzone intermittent timeout (2026-03-16)

- [ ] **DatahubShmQueueTest.ShmQueueWriteFlexzone** — intermittently times out at 60s under
  `-j2` but passes instantly in isolation. Deep analysis (2026-03-16) confirmed: test logic is
  entirely non-blocking (create DataBlockProducer, call write_flexzone(), assert non-null);
  shared_secret 70007 is unique; channel name has nanosecond timestamp; no SHM contention
  possible. **Likely root cause identified:** uncapped ThreePhaseBackoff Phase 3
  (`iteration * 10us` with no ceiling) could grow to multi-second sleeps if SharedSpinLock
  contention occurred during LifecycleGuard shutdown under parallel load. Fixed by capping
  Phase 3 at 10ms (kMaxPhase3DelayUs, commit 1d3e584). **If this recurs after the cap fix,**
  investigate: (1) Logger cv_.notify_one miss, (2) fork/exec scheduling starvation,
  (3) whether the *same* test consistently fails or different tests rotate.
  - Also seen on `DatahubSlotDrainingTest.DrainHoldTrueNeverReturnsNullptr` (same session).
  - Also seen on `DatahubHeaderStructureTest.SchemaHashesPopulatedWithTemplateApi` (2026-03-18,
    exit code 143 = SIGTERM after 60s, child stderr shows test lambda completed successfully;
    possible lifecycle teardown hang under `-j2` load). Failed once, passed 10/10 in isolation
    and 1/1 on full-suite rerun. Same class of issue: non-reproducing under load.

### Codex Review: Testing docs staleness (2026-03-15)

- [ ] **README_testing.md stale** — Phase C broker/message-plane still says "To be implemented"
  but broker tests already exist. Platform matrix claims all 4 OS must run suite, but CI
  is Linux-only. Examples reference `./test_layer2_filelock` (old style). Update to reflect
  current ctest-based workflow and actual CI coverage.

### Layer 4: pylabhub-actor Tests — ARCHIVED (actor eliminated 2026-03-01)

`pylabhub-actor` and its test suite (`tests/test_layer4_actor/`) were removed from the build
and deleted from disk on 2026-03-02 (HEP-CORE-0018 decision). The completed unit tests
(config parsing, role metrics, CLI keygen/register-with, 98 tests) are preserved in git history.
Replaced by standalone `pylabhub-producer` + `pylabhub-consumer` + `pylabhub-processor` binaries.

LoopPolicy C++ metrics tests (HEP-CORE-0008) are fully covered in
`tests/test_layer3_datahub/test_datahub_loop_policy.cpp` (tests 6–16, secrets 80006–80016).

### ScriptHost / PythonScriptHost threading model (tests done — 2026-02-28)
**Status**: ✅ Complete — 10 tests in `tests/test_layer2_service/test_script_host.cpp`

- [x] **ScriptHost base threading** — threaded startup/shutdown, idempotent shutdown, early-stop
- [x] **ScriptHost exception in do_initialize** — exception propagated via future to caller
- [x] **ScriptHost returns false without signal** — set exception on promise; base_startup_ throws
- [x] **ScriptHost direct mode (Lua path)** — do_initialize on calling thread; signal_ready by base

### PythonInterpreter / Admin Shell / Consumer ctypes ✅ Complete (2026-03-05)
**Status**: ✅ All three items covered by existing L4 integration tests.

- [x] **HP-C1 — `pylabhub.reset()` deadlock regression** — `test_admin_shell.cpp:271–338`:
  `HP_C1_Reset_NoDeadlock` (no hang) + `HP_C1_Reset_ClearsNamespace` (vars cleared, builtins preserved).
- [x] **HP-C2 — stdout/stderr leak on exec() exception** — `test_admin_shell.cpp:342–394`:
  `HP_C2_Exception_StdoutRestored` (output works after exception) + `HP_C2_Exception_ErrorReturned`.
- [x] **BN-H1 — Consumer binary ctypes.from_buffer_copy round-trip** — `test_pipeline_roundtrip.cpp`:
  consumer reads `in_slot.counter` and `in_slot.doubled` (ctypes fields from `from_buffer_copy()`)
  and verifies transformation correctness (`doubled == counter * 10.0 * 2.0`).

### HubConfig script-block fields (tests done — 2026-02-28)
**Status**: ✅ Complete — 9 tests in `tests/test_layer3_datahub/test_datahub_hub_config_script.cpp`

- [x] **`hub_script_dir()` from JSON** — resolves to `<hub_dir>/my_script/python`
- [x] **`script_type()` from JSON** — reads `"type"` field correctly
- [x] **`tick_interval_ms()` override** — `"tick_interval_ms":500`; verify 500
- [x] **`health_log_interval_ms()` override** — `"health_log_interval_ms":30000`; verify 30000
- [x] **`hub_dir()` matches config path parent** — lifecycle sets hub_dir correctly
- [x] **`tick_interval_ms()` default** — omit key; verify 1000 ms default
- [x] **`health_log_interval_ms()` default** — verify 60000 ms default
- [x] **`hub_script_dir()` default absent** — no `"script"` block; verify empty path
- [x] **`script_type()` default absent** — no `"script"` block; verify empty string

### High Priority
- [x] Consumer registration to broker — ✅ done (test_datahub_broker_consumer.cpp)
- [x] Broker schema registry tests — ✅ done (test_datahub_broker_schema.cpp, 7 tests, HEP-CORE-0016 Phase 3)
- [ ] MessageHub error paths with broker
- [ ] Recovery: cross-process zombie detection (broker-coordinated) — requires broker protocol
- [ ] Recovery: slot-checksum in-place repair (current repair path reinitialises header; needs WriteAttach mode instead of create)

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Flexible zone by-name access edge cases
- [ ] Transaction API exception safety (comprehensive)
- [ ] Diagnostic API comprehensive coverage

### Low Priority
- [ ] stuck_duration_ms in diagnostics (requires timestamp on acquire)
- [ ] Schema versioning and compatibility rules
- [ ] Migration path testing
- [ ] **FlexZone atomic-ref usage example** — test demonstrating `std::atomic_ref<T>` pattern
  for out-of-transaction lock-free FlexZone access (from RAII_LAYER_TODO backlog)
- [ ] **Layout checksum stability** — attach with mismatched layout (should fail); structured
  buffer alignment test (8-byte, 16-byte types); large flex zone (multi-page); zero flex zone
  (slots only) — (from MEMORY_LAYOUT_TODO backlog; low priority, layout is stable)
- [ ] **RAII move semantics audit** — confirm all RAII handles support efficient move (no copy)
- [ ] **Zero-cost abstraction verification** — profile `with_transaction` vs primitive API
  with optimizations; confirm no overhead on hot path

- [ ] **L4 DEFERRED**: Config schema error paths (invalid schema in JSON config → role host aborts). Schema parsing validation covered at L2 by test_schema_validation.cpp.

### 2026-03-07 (Port formula audit — overflow + cross-binary collision fixes)
- ✅ **Root cause found**: Two parallel test failures (`ZmqQueueTest.SchemaTag_Match_DeliversItem`
  port 49980 and `PipelineRoundtripTest.ProducerProcessorConsumer_E2E` "hub.pubkey not written")
  were caused by logic errors in port formulas, not random collisions:
  1. **L4 overflow**: `kBasePort=16570/17570` + `(pid%5000)*10` → max port 67560 > 65535.
     For `pid%5000 >= 4897` (~2% of PIDs), hub broker silently fails to bind → test timeout.
  2. **L3 schema_ep overflow**: `48000 + (pid%2000)*12` → max 71988 > 65535.
     For `pid%2000 >= 1461` (~27% of PIDs), ZmqQueue schema-mode tests get invalid ports.
  3. **Cross-binary range overlap**: L4 tests (15570–65560) overlapped with L3 ZmqQueue (33000–65005).
     Two parallel CTest processes with suitable PIDs can compute the same TCP port simultaneously.
- ✅ **Fixes applied** (4 files, no API changes):
  - `test_admin_shell.cpp`: kBasePort=10000, pid%500*6 → range 10000–12999
  - `test_pipeline_roundtrip.cpp`: kBasePort=13000, pid%500*6 → range 13000–15999
  - `test_channel_broadcast.cpp`: kBasePort=16000, pid%500*6 → range 16000–18999
  - `test_datahub_hub_zmq_queue.cpp`: `schema_ep()` uses pid%1460 → max port 65518
  - L3 tests (33000–65535) and L4 tests (10000–18999) are now **non-overlapping**.
  - **884/884 still passing** after fix.

### 2026-03-03 (HEP Document Review + Code Review + Source Polish)
- ✅ **All 17 HEP documents updated** — mermaid diagrams, source file references, status fields
- ✅ **5-pass code review** (L0-1, L2, L3, L4, cross-cutting) — all passes EXCELLENT/PASS

    `recursion_guard.hpp` wrong filename in @file, `hub_queue.hpp`/`hub_processor.hpp` stale
    HEP-0012 cross-references → HEP-0015, `data_block.hpp` include path inconsistency
- ✅ **Umbrella header reorganization** — 15 orphan headers added to appropriate umbrella:
  `result.hpp` → L1; `uid_utils/uuid_utils/interactive_signal_handler/zmq_context` → L2;
  `heartbeat_manager/recovery_api/slot_diagnostics/slot_recovery/integrity_validator` → L3a;
  `channel_access_policy/channel_pattern/data_block_mutex` → L3b

### 2026-03-02 (Test Gap Closure + Script Host Deduplication)
- ✅ **Script host deduplication** — Extracted 14 shared functions + 3 types from
  processor/producer/consumer `*_script_host.cpp` into `schema_types.hpp` (types)
  and `schema_utils.hpp` + `python_helpers.hpp` (inline functions). Types now in `pylabhub::hub` namespace.

  RAII destructor on installed handler, force_daemon config cycle. All use `force_daemon=true`.
- ✅ **B4: Messenger callback registration tests** (3 tests) — added to `test_datahub_messagehub.cpp`;
  `on_channel_closing` global register, per-channel register/deregister (nullptr), `on_consumer_died` register.
  **Total: 734/734 passing (712 + 22 new tests).**

### 2026-03-02 (L0–L3 Test Gap Closure — Phase 2, Audit-Driven)

  with name (3), validators (5), `sanitize_name_part` (5: normal/special chars/empty/too long/dashes).
- ✅ **L2 ActorVault tests** (12 tests) — new `test_actor_vault.cpp`; mirrors HubVault pattern;
  creation (4: writes file, restricted perms, valid Z85, empty password), opening (4: correct password,
  wrong password throws, corrupted throws, missing throws), encryption (2: secrets not plaintext,
  different UID different ciphertext), identity (2: UID roundtrip, different UIDs different keys).
  Permission test guarded with `#ifndef PYLABHUB_PLATFORM_WIN64`.
- ✅ **L2 ZmqContext tests** (3 tests) — new `test_zmq_context.cpp`; lifecycle fixture with
  `GetZMQContextModule()`; `GetContext_ReturnsValid`, `GetContext_SameInstance`, `CreateSocket_Works`.
- ✅ **L3 ZmqQueue tests** (11 tests) — new `test_datahub_hub_zmq_queue.cpp`; factory (2), lifecycle (3),
  read/write roundtrip (3: single item, multiple items, read timeout returns null), write semantics (2:
  abort not sent, item_size correct), metadata (1: name returns endpoint). All use `tcp://127.0.0.1:<port>`.
- ✅ **L3 SchemaLibrary file-loading tests** (3 tests) — added `DatahubSchemaFileLoadTest` to

  `actor_vault.hpp` (getpass), `backoff_strategy.hpp` (sleep resolution), `shared_memory_spinlock.cpp` (PID reuse).
  **Total: 651/651 passing (588 + 63 new tests).**

### 2026-03-02 (HEP-CORE-0016 Phase 4: SchemaStore lifecycle)
- ✅ **SchemaStore lifecycle singleton tests: `SchemaRegistryTest`** (8 tests) —
  `test_datahub_schema_registry.cpp` in `tests/test_layer3_datahub/`; lifecycle fixture
  (Logger + SchemaStore); covers `GetInstance_SameAddress`, `LifecycleInitialized_True`,
  `RegisterAndGet`, `IdentifyByHash`, `GetUnknown_Nullopt`, `IdentifyUnknown_Nullopt`,
  `Reload_ClearsAndReloads`, `ListSchemas`. **Total: 588/588 passing.**

### 2026-03-02 (Layer 4 processor tests)
- ✅ **Layer 4 config unit tests: `ProcessorConfigTest`** (10 tests) — `test_processor_config.cpp`
  in `tests/test_layer4_processor/`; `PureApiTest` fixture; `processor_config.cpp` compiled directly
  into test binary; covers `from_json_file` (basic fields, uid autogen, in/out schemas, missing
  in_channel, missing out_channel, malformed JSON, file not found), `from_directory` (with script_path
  resolution), `overflow_policy` default (block) and invalid (throws).
- ✅ **Layer 4 CLI integration tests: `ProcessorCliTest`** (6 tests) — `test_processor_cli.cpp`;
  `IsolatedProcessTest` fixture; spawns `pylabhub-processor` binary via `WorkerProcess` (path
  derived as `g_self_exe_path/../bin/pylabhub-processor`); covers `--init` (directory structure +
  default values including both in/out channels and overflow_policy), `--keygen` (vault file created,
  stdout mentions `Processor vault written to` + `public_key`), `--validate` (exits 0, prints
  "Validation passed"), malformed JSON (non-zero exit + "Config error" in stderr), and missing
  config file (non-zero exit). **Total: 580/580 passing.**

### 2026-03-02 (HEP-CORE-0016 Phase 3 — Broker Schema Protocol Tests)
- ✅ **7 `BrokerSchemaTest` tests** — `test_datahub_broker_schema.cpp` in `tests/test_layer3_datahub/`:
  - `SchemaId_StoredOnReg` — producer registers with schema_id; query_channel_schema echoes it back
  - `SchemaBlds_StoredOnReg` — BLDS string stored at REG_REQ time and returned via SCHEMA_REQ
  - `SchemaHash_ReturnedOnQuery` — raw 32-byte hash → hex-encoded round-trip via broker
  - `SchemaReq_UnknownChannel_ReturnsNullopt` — query for unregistered channel returns nullopt
  - `ConsumerSchemaId_IdMatch_Succeeds` — consumer expected_schema_id matches producer's → connect succeeds
  - `ConsumerSchemaId_Mismatch_Fails` — consumer expected_schema_id differs → connect_channel returns nullopt
  - `ConsumerSchemaId_EmptyProducer_Fails` — anonymous producer + consumer expects schema_id → fails
  - Uses in-process `LocalBrokerHandle` pattern (ephemeral port, empty SchemaLibrary)
  - Bug fix: `messenger_protocol.cpp` CONSUMER_REG error now returns nullopt (was fire-and-forget)
  **Total: 564/564 passing.**

### 2026-03-02 (HEP-CORE-0016 Phase 2 — Schema Integration Tests)
- ✅ **`validate_named_schema<DataT, FlexT>(schema_id, lib)`** — template free function added to
  `schema_library.hpp`; performs: (1) forward lookup via `lib.get(schema_id)`, (2) `sizeof(DataT)`
  vs `slot_info.struct_size` size check, (3) BLDS hash check when `PYLABHUB_SCHEMA_BEGIN/MEMBER/END`
  macros used (detected by `has_schema_registry_v<DataT>`), (4) flexzone size + hash check when
  `FlexT != void`. Throws `SchemaValidationException` on any mismatch or unknown ID; no-op when
  `schema_id` is empty. Companion `validate_named_schema_from_env<>()` builds library from
  `default_search_dirs()` + `load_all()` then delegates.
- ✅ **`has_schema_registry<T>` trait** added to `schema_blds.hpp` — detects `SchemaRegistry<T>`
  specialization via `std::void_t`; exported as `has_schema_registry_v<T>`.
- ✅ **`ProducerOptions::schema_id`** and **`ConsumerOptions::expected_schema_id`** — new `std::string`
  fields (default `""`); when non-empty, `Producer::create<F,D>()` / `Consumer::connect<F,D>()`
  call `validate_named_schema_from_env<DataBlockT, FlexZoneT>(schema_id)` at entry.
- ✅ **7 `DatahubSchemaPhase2Test` tests** — `MatchingStruct_NoThrow`, `EmptySchemaId_NoCheck`,
  `UnknownId_Throws`, `SlotSizeMismatch_Throws`, `SlotHashMismatch_Throws`,
  `FlexzoneSizeMismatch_Throws`, `MatchingFlexzone_NoThrow`. Use in-memory `SchemaLibrary`
  (no file I/O, no env vars). **Total: 557/557 passing.**

### 2026-03-02 (Layer 4 producer + consumer tests)
- ✅ **Layer 4 config unit tests: `ProducerConfigTest`** (8 tests) — `test_producer_config.cpp`
  in `tests/test_layer4_producer/`; `PureApiTest` fixture; `producer_config.cpp` compiled directly
  into test binary; covers `from_json_file` (basic fields, uid autogen, schema fields, missing channel,
  malformed JSON, file not found), `from_directory` (with omitted `hub_dir`), and
  `stop_on_script_error` default false.
- ✅ **Layer 4 CLI integration tests: `ProducerCliTest`** (6 tests) — `test_producer_cli.cpp`;
  `IsolatedProcessTest` fixture; spawns `pylabhub-producer` binary via `WorkerProcess` (path
  derived as `g_self_exe_path/../bin/pylabhub-producer`); covers `--init` (directory structure +
  default values), `--keygen` (vault file created, stdout mentions `public_key`), `--validate`
  (exits 0, prints "Validation passed"), malformed JSON (non-zero exit + "Config error" in
  stderr), and missing config file (non-zero exit). Key fix: `script_path` must be the *parent*
  of `script/<type>/`, not `script/` itself — binary appends `script/<type>/__init__.py`.
- ✅ **Layer 4 config unit tests: `ConsumerConfigTest`** (6 tests) — `test_consumer_config.cpp`
  in `tests/test_layer4_consumer/`; symmetric to producer; `CONS-` prefix; no `shm_slot_count`,
  no `update_checksum`; covers `from_json_file` (5 variants) and `from_directory`.
- ✅ **Layer 4 CLI integration tests: `ConsumerCliTest`** (6 tests) — `test_consumer_cli.cpp`;
  spawns `pylabhub-consumer` binary; same 6 scenarios as producer CLI tests; "Consumer vault
  written to" in stdout for keygen. **Total: 550/550 passing.**

### 2026-02-28 (Actor CLI integration tests)
- ✅ **Layer 4 CLI tests: `pylabhub-actor` CLI integration** (12 tests) — `test_layer4_actor_cli`
  executable using `pylabhub::test_framework` (`WorkerProcess`/`g_self_exe_path`); actor binary
  derived from staged path (`../bin/pylabhub-actor` relative to test binary); covers:
  `--keygen` (write/missing-keyfile/create-parent-dir/overwrite), `--register-with`
  (append/idempotent/missing-actor/missing-hub), config error paths (malformed JSON,
  missing roles, invalid kind, file not found). Fixed: `auth.keyfile` is inside `actor` block,
  not top-level. All Tier 1 (no Python/broker). Total: **585/585 passing**.

### 2026-02-28 (ScriptHost + HubConfig script-block tests + CMake option)
- ✅ **Layer 2 tests: ScriptHost threading model** (10 tests) — `tests/test_layer2_service/test_script_host.cpp`:
  `test_layer2_script_host` executable; mock subclasses; threaded mode (startup/shutdown/idempotent/
  early-stop/exception propagation/false-without-signal); direct mode (startup-ready/shutdown-finalizes/
  failure-throws). Note: `ThreadedEarlyStop` checks `is_ready()` only AFTER `shutdown()` (join provides
  happens-before; earlier check is racy vs thread_fn_ clearing `ready_`).
- ✅ **Layer 3 tests: HubConfig script-block fields** (9 tests) — `tests/test_layer3_datahub/test_datahub_hub_config_script.cpp`:
  two lifecycle fixtures (Logger + CryptoUtils + FileLock + JsonConfig + HubConfig); configured fixture
  (hub.json with all script/python fields; 5 tests); defaults fixture (absent script/python block; 4 tests).
- ✅ **CMake: `PYLABHUB_PYTHON_REQUIREMENTS_FILE`** — `cmake/ToplevelOptions.cmake` FILEPATH cache var;
  `third_party/cmake/python.cmake` uses variable (+ existence check); `CMakeLists.txt` status message.
  **Total: 573/573 passing**

### 2026-02-27 (LoopPolicy edge-case tests + code review fixes)
- ✅ **Layer 3 tests: LoopPolicy edge cases** (11 tests) — extended `test_datahub_loop_policy.cpp`:
  - 7 edge-case tests (secrets 80006–80012): ZeroOnCreation, MaxRateNoOverrun, LastSlotWorkUsPopulated,
    LastIterationUsPopulated, MaxIterationUsPeak, ContextElapsedUsMonotonic, CtxMetricsPassThrough
  - 4 RAII-specific tests (secrets 80013–80016): RaiiProducerLastSlotWorkUsMultiIter,
    RaiiProducerMetricsViaSlots, RaiiProducerOverrunViaSlots, RaiiConsumerLastSlotWorkUs
  - Fixed RAII release path: `last_slot_exec_us` set in `release_write_handle()` and
    `release_consume_handle()` (symmetric RAII destructor + explicit call paths)
  - Fixed RAII multi-iter producer race: `SlotWriteHandle`/`SlotConsumeHandle` store per-handle
    `t_slot_acquired_` (not `owner->t_iter_start_` which gets overwritten between iterations)
  **Total: 550/550 passing**
- ✅ **CODE_REVIEW.md triage complete** (2026-02-27): All 8 critical + 12 high items verified
  as false positives or pre-existing fixes; deferred medium items documented in review.

### 2026-02-26 (Connection policy + security identity)
- ✅ **Layer 3 tests: ConnectionPolicy enforcement** (11 tests) — new `test_datahub_connection_policy.cpp`:
  - Suite 1 (4 tests): `to_str`/`from_str` round-trips, unknown-string fallback to Open
  - Suite 2 (7 tests): Open/Required/Verified broker enforcement, per-channel glob override,
    ephemeral port (`tcp://127.0.0.1:0`) prevents parallel ctest-j collisions
  **Total: 539/539 passing** (528 pre-existing + 11 new Phase 3 connection policy tests)

### 2026-02-23
- ✅ **Layer 2 tests: HubVault** (15 tests) — `tests/test_layer2_service/test_hub_vault.cpp`:
  create/open/publish_public_key basics, file permissions (0600 vault, 0644 pubkey),
  Z85 keypair and 64-char hex token validation, entropy (two creates differ), wrong password throws,
  corrupted vault throws, missing vault throws, `VaultFileDoesNotContainPlaintextSecrets`,
  `EncryptDecryptRoundTrip`, `DifferentHubUidProducesDifferentCiphertext` (cross-uid open fails).
  No lifecycle; uses `gtest_main`; Argon2id ~0.5s/call → 120s timeout.
  **Total: 488/488 passing** (479 pre-existing + 15 new Layer 2 HubVault tests — 1 flaky lifecycle timeout pre-existing, passes in isolation).
- ✅ **Layer 4 tests: ActorConfig parsing** (32 tests) — `tests/test_layer4_actor/test_actor_config.cpp`:
  `loop_timing` (fixed_pace/compensating/default/invalid), `broker_pubkey`, `broker` endpoint,
  `interval_ms`/`timeout_ms`, all four `ValidationPolicy` fields + defaults + invalid values,
  uid auto-gen / non-conforming (warning, no throw), multi-role, empty roles map, all error cases.
  No lifecycle init; `LOGGER_COMPILE_LEVEL=0`.
- ✅ **Layer 4 tests: ActorRoleAPI metrics** (21 tests) — `tests/test_layer4_actor/test_actor_role_metrics.cpp`:
  initial-zero invariant, `increment_script_errors`, `increment_loop_overruns`,
  `set_last_cycle_work_us`, `reset_all_role_run_metrics` (all 3 counters; does not reset identity
  fields; accumulation after reset; no-op on fresh API), `slot_valid` flag, all identity getters,
  instance independence. All inline methods; no Python interpreter init.
  **Total: 479/479 passing** (426 pre-existing + 53 new Layer 4 tests).

### 2026-02-21 (gap-fixing session)
- ✅ **426/426 tests pass** — no regressions after all gap-fix changes (demo scripts, --keygen, schema hash, timeout constants)
- ✅ **Layer 4 test gap identified** — actor integration test plan updated with schema hash mismatch test and --keygen test
- ✅ **426/426 tests pass** — no regressions after pylabhub-actor, UID enforcement, SharedSpinLockPy additions (earlier in same day)

### 2026-02-17 (Integrity validation tests)
- ✅ **Integrity repair test suite** (`test_datahub_integrity_repair.cpp` + workers) — 3 tests:
  fresh ChecksumPolicy::Enforced block validates successfully (slot checksum path exercised);
  layout checksum corruption detected (FAILED on both repair=false and repair=true — not repairable);
  magic number corruption detected (FAILED). Secrets 78001–78003.
  Slot-checksum in-place repair deferred: existing repair path uses `create_datablock_producer_impl`
  which reinitialises the header — incompatible with in-place repair testing.
  **Total: 384/384 passing.**

### 2026-02-17 (Recovery scenario facility tests)
- ✅ **Recovery scenario test suite** (`test_datahub_recovery_scenarios.cpp` + workers) — 6 tests:
  zombie writer (dead PID in write_lock → release_zombie_writer → FREE);
  zombie readers (reader_count injected → release_zombie_readers → 0);
  force_reset on dead writer (dead write_lock → force_reset succeeds without force flag);
  dead consumer cleanup (fake heartbeat with dead PID → cleanup_dead_consumers removes it);
  is_process_alive sentinel (kDeadPid=INT32_MAX → false; self PID → true);
  force_reset safety guard (alive write_lock → RECOVERY_UNSAFE; recoveryAPI logs ERROR).
  Secrets 77001–77004, 77006. **Scope: facility layer only** — full broker-coordinated
  zombie detection remains deferred (Phase C, requires broker protocol).
  **Total: 381/381 passing.**

### 2026-02-17 (WriteAttach mode tests)
- ✅ **WriteAttach test suite** (`test_datahub_write_attach.cpp` + workers) — 4 tests:
  basic roundtrip (hub creates, source attaches R/W and writes, creator consumer reads);
  secret mismatch → nullptr; schema mismatch → nullptr; segment persists after writer detach.
  Secrets 76001–76004. Verifies broker-owned shared memory model.
  **Total: 375/375 passing.**

### 2026-02-17 (coverage gap tests completed)
- ✅ **Config validation test** (`test_datahub_config_validation.cpp` + workers) — 5 tests:
  all four mandatory-field throw cases + valid config succeeds. Secrets 73001–73005.
- ✅ **Header structure test** (`test_datahub_header_structure.cpp` + workers) — 3 tests:
  template API populates both schema hashes; impl with nullptr zeroes them; different types
  produce different hashes. Secrets 74001–74004. Fix: `flex_zone_size = sizeof(FlexZoneT)` required.
- ✅ **C API validation test** (`test_datahub_c_api_validation.cpp` + workers) — 5 tests:
  `datablock_validate_integrity` succeeds on fresh; fails on nonexistent (allow ERROR logs);
  `datablock_get_metrics` shows 0 commits; `datablock_diagnose_slot` shows FREE;
  `datablock_diagnose_all_slots` returns capacity entries. Secrets 75001–75005.
  **Total: 371/371 passing.**

### 2026-02-17 (docs audit — test refactoring status verified)
- ✅ **Test refactoring complete** — All Phase 1-3 and Phase 4 (T4.1-T4.5) tasks from the
  test refactoring plan are done: shared test types (`test_datahub_types.h`), removed obsolete
  non-template tests, all enabled tests compile; new tests added for schema validation,
  c_api checksum, exception safety, handle semantics. Phase 5 renaming also complete (all
  files follow `test_datahub_*` convention). Verified: 358/358 passing.
  — All transient test planning docs archived to `docs/archive/transient-2026-02-17/`

### 2026-03-07
- ✅ `DatahubSlotDrainingTest` extended to 9 tests (SHM-C2 audit):
  - `DrainHoldTrueNeverReturnsNullptr`: directly tests SHM-C2 core invariant — `DataBlockProducer::acquire_write_slot()` (drain_hold=true) never returns nullptr on drain timeout; verified still blocked after 4 × timeout_ms intervals
  - `DrainHoldTrueMetricsAccumulated`: verifies `writer_reader_timeout_count` and `writer_blocked_total_ns` both accumulate on each drain-hold timer reset
  - Fixed pre-existing stalling test `DrainingTimeoutRestoresCommitted` (#431): replaced `DataBlockProducer::acquire_write_slot()` (drain_hold=true → deadlock) with C API `slot_rw_acquire_write()` (drain_hold=false → SLOT_ACQUIRE_TIMEOUT); documented C API passes header=nullptr so metrics not updated via this path

- ✅ **Sleep-based race condition audit — all 8 occurrences fixed** in `datahub_hub_processor_workers.cpp`:
  - All `std::this_thread::sleep_for(Nms)` used to ORDER concurrent operations replaced with `poll_until(condition, deadline)`
  - Key patterns used: `poll_until([&proc] { return proc.iteration_count() >= N; })` for processor loop sync; `poll_until([&proc] { return proc.out_drop_count() >= 1; })` for counter lag; `iteration_count > n_before + 1` barrier for handler hot-swap and handler removal
  - Fixed `ProcessorHandlerRemoval` flaky test: was a race between `sleep_for(300ms)` and handler load; now uses `iteration_count` barrier to guarantee null-handler path entered before asserting output queue empty
  - 5 `sleep_for(100ms)` calls after ZMQ `start()` intentionally retained — these wait for TCP connection establishment (no synchronous callback available), not ordering of operations
- ✅ **`test_sync_utils.h` shared facility created** — `tests/test_framework/test_sync_utils.h`; `poll_until(pred, timeout, poll_ms)` template; lightweight (only `<chrono>` + `<thread>`); no gtest/lifecycle dependency; available transitively via `shared_test_helpers.h`; correctly placed in test framework (sleep-based polling is test-only — production code uses busy-spin)
  — 884/884 tests passing

### 2026-02-17
- ✅ `DatahubSlotDrainingTest` (7 tests): DRAINING state machine tests — entered on wraparound,
  rejects new readers, resolves after reader release, timeout restores COMMITTED, no reader races
  on clean wraparound; plus ring-full barrier proof tests for Sequential and Sequential_sync
  — `tests/test_layer3_datahub/test_datahub_c_api_slot_protocol.cpp`,
    `tests/test_layer3_datahub/workers/datahub_c_api_draining_workers.cpp`
- ✅ Proved DRAINING structurally unreachable for Sequential / Sequential_sync
  (ring-full check before fetch_add creates arithmetic barrier) — documented in
  `docs/HEP/HEP-CORE-0007-DataHub-Protocol-and-Policy.md` § 11, `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDANCE.md` Pitfall 11

### 2026-02-14
- ✅ Writer timeout metrics split test (lock vs reader timeout)
- ✅ Unified metrics API tests (total_slots_written, state snapshot)

### 2026-02-13
- ✅ Config validation tests (explicit parameters required)
- ✅ Shared spinlock API tests (get_spinlock, spinlock_count)

### 2026-02-12
- ✅ ConsumerSyncPolicy tests (all three modes)
- ✅ High-load single reader integrity test
- ✅ MessageHub Phase C groundwork (no-broker paths)

## Notes

- Test pattern choice: PureApiTest (no lifecycle), LifecycleManagedTest (shared lifecycle), WorkerProcess (multi-process or finalizes lifecycle). See `docs/README/README_testing.md`.
- CTest runs each test in separate process; direct execution runs all in one process. Use WorkerProcess for isolation.
- When test fails: scrutinize before coding. Is it revealing a bug or is the test wrong? See `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDANCE.md` § Responding to test failures.
