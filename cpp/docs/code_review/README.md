# Transient code review (module-targeted)

**Purpose:** This directory holds **transient** review comments and reports that target a **specific module** (e.g. DataHub, MessageHub, FileLock). Use it for in-progress or one-off reviews, not for the general review process (that lives in **`docs/CODE_REVIEW_GUIDANCE.md`**).

**Lifecycle:**

1. When starting a module-targeted review, add the review document here (e.g. `REVIEW_<Module>_YYYY-MM-DD.md` or similar).
2. Reference follow-up work in **`docs/DATAHUB_TODO.md`** (or the relevant TODO) so the plan tracks the review outcomes.
3. After the review is fully addressed (follow-ups done, content merged into IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDANCE or other core docs as needed), **move** the review document to **`docs/archive/`** in a dated folder (e.g. `archive/transient-YYYY-MM-DD/`) and **record the activity** in **`docs/DOC_ARCHIVE_LOG.md`**.

Do not use this folder for long-term storage; keep it for active, in-progress reviews only. For where information lives and how to archive, see **`docs/DOC_STRUCTURE.md`**.
