/**
 * @file role_identity_policy.hpp
 * @brief Hub-side gate for verifying a connecting role's claimed
 *        identity at REG_REQ / CONSUMER_REG_REQ time (legacy
 *        placeholder).
 *
 * 🚧 **Superseded by HEP-CORE-0035 (in design, not implemented).**
 * The `RoleIdentityPolicy` enum + `KnownRole` + `ChannelPolicyOverride`
 * types here pre-date the CURVE-required role model and the HEP-0022
 * federation model.  They operate on self-asserted JSON identity
 * strings and never consult the connecting socket's CURVE pubkey.
 * HEP-CORE-0035 replaces them with a two-layer enforcement model
 * (ZAP pubkey allowlist at the socket layer + federation-trust gate
 * at the registration layer).  Until HEP-0035 Phase 6 retires this
 * code, the types remain live: settable directly on
 * `BrokerService::Config` by tests and (eventually) Phase 9 wiring;
 * **not** parsed from hub.json by `pylabhub::config::HubConfig` (Phase
 * 1 deliberately omits the auth fields — see HEP-0033 §15 Phase 1 +
 * HEP-0035 §3).
 *
 * What this gate actually does: at REG_REQ (producer) and
 * CONSUMER_REG_REQ (consumer), the broker reads `role_name` +
 * `role_uid` from the request body — strings the connecting role put
 * there itself — and applies one of four strictness modes based on
 * `RoleIdentityPolicy` (with optional per-channel-glob override via
 * `ChannelPolicyOverride`).  The "channel" in the legacy name
 * referred only to the glob-based override selector, NOT to what is
 * being verified.  The subject of verification is the **role's
 * identity**; "registration identity policy" is what it really is.
 *
 * Legacy semantics (do NOT treat as design):
 *   Open     — no identity required; any client connects.
 *   Tracked  — identity accepted and logged if provided; not required.
 *   Required — role_name + role_uid must be present in REG_REQ /
 *              CONSUMER_REG_REQ (non-empty strings).
 *   Verified — role_name + role_uid must string-match an entry in
 *              `known_roles[]`.
 *
 * Renamed 2026-05-13 from `channel_access_policy.hpp` /
 * `ConnectionPolicy` / `ChannelPolicy` to reflect what the mechanism
 * actually verifies.  Rename is cosmetic; the placeholder remains on
 * its HEP-0035 §8 Phase 6 deletion path.

/**
 * @enum RoleIdentityPolicy
 * @brief Strictness mode for verifying a connecting role's
 *        self-asserted identity (`role_name` + `role_uid`) at
 *        REG_REQ / CONSUMER_REG_REQ.
 *
 * Levels escalate from fully permissive (Open) to allowlist-only
 * (Verified).  A per-channel override via
 * `ChannelPolicyOverride::policy` can tighten (but not loosen) the
 * effective policy for specific channel glob patterns.
 *
 * **Where set (today):**
 *   - `BrokerService::Config::role_identity_policy` (`broker_service.hpp`).
 *     Set directly by tests (`test_datahub_role_identity_policy.cpp`).
 *     **Not** parsed from hub.json — `HubBrokerConfig` deliberately
 *     omits the field pending HEP-CORE-0035.
 * **Where checked:** `BrokerServiceImpl::check_role_identity()` in
 *   `broker_service.cpp` — called on every REG_REQ (producer) and
 *   CONSUMER_REG_REQ (consumer).  Returns an error response on
 *   rejection; std::nullopt on acceptance.
 * **Effective policy:** `BrokerServiceImpl::effective_role_identity_policy()`
 *   picks the most-restrictive matching `ChannelPolicyOverride`,
 *   falling back to the Config default.
