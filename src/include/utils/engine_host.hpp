/**
 * @file engine_host.hpp
 * @brief EngineHost<ApiT> — template base for script-hosting start/stop.
 *
 * Not a `LifecycleGuard` module — the host's own start/stop is invoked
 * directly by the binary's main (or by tests), distinct from the
 * process-wide `LifecycleGuard` modules (Logger, ZMQContext, …) that
 * must be active before any EngineHost is constructed.
 *
 * (Renamed from `role_host_base.hpp` on 2026-04-23 alongside the
 * HEP-CORE-0033 G1 refactor that promoted the former `RoleHostBase`
 * class to a template.  The type alias `RoleHostBase =
 * EngineHost<RoleAPIBase>` at the bottom of this header preserves
 * source-level compatibility for role-side callers.)
 *
 * Unifies the public start/stop surface that binaries (`plh_role`,
 * future `plh_hub`) call on a script host:
 *
 *     construct → startup_() → (is_running()/wait_for_wakeup() loop) → shutdown_()
 *
 * The trailing-underscore methods follow the project convention: they are
 * intended to be called only by code tightly coupled with the role/hub
 * module (binary mains, not generic external consumers).
 *
 * The class is a template parameterised on `ApiT`, the script-visible API
 * class.  Two instantiations exist:
 *
 *     using RoleHostBase        = EngineHost<RoleAPIBase>;   // role side ✅
 *     using HubScriptRunnerBase = EngineHost<HubAPI>;        // hub side (Phase 7)
 *
 * Three role-side concrete classes derive from `RoleHostBase`
 * (Producer/Consumer/Processor); one hub-side concrete class derives
 * from `HubScriptRunnerBase` (`HubScriptRunner`).  Each implements a
 * single pure virtual hook, @ref worker_main_, which runs the full
 * engine-and-loop sequence on the host's worker thread.
 *
 * Note (per §G1 retraction below): the OUTER hub container `HubHost`
 * is a plain concrete class — NOT derived from `EngineHost`.  The
 * `EngineHost<HubAPI>` instantiation is for the inner script-thread
 * runtime (`HubScriptRunner`), which is one of `HubHost`'s owned
 * subsystems.
 *
 * Base owns shared state (role_tag, config, engine, RoleHostCore, ApiT,
 * ready-promise). Derived owns role/hub-specific state (schemas, queues,
 * BrokerRequestComm, InboxQueue, CycleOps for role side; admin/event
 * pumps for hub side). The @ref ApiT is constructed lazily in @ref
 * startup_ so the worker thread can be spawned via its ThreadManager —
 * putting it under the same bounded-join / ERROR-on-timeout contract as
 * every other role- or hub-scope thread.
 *
 * Contract on `ApiT`:
 *   - Constructor `ApiT(RoleHostCore &, std::string role_tag, std::string uid)`
 *   - `ThreadManager &thread_manager()` accessor
 *   (HubAPI will satisfy both when HEP-0033 Phase 8 lands.)
 *
 * New hosts add custom worker threads by calling @c api().thread_manager()
 * @c .spawn(...) inside their @ref worker_main_; all such threads are
 * drained by `ThreadManager::~ThreadManager` during @ref shutdown_.
 *
 * Thread safety: construct, startup(), shutdown() on one thread (usually
 * main). is_running()/script_load_ok()/wait_for_wakeup() may be called
 * from the same thread while the worker runs. Not copyable, not movable
 * (owns an internal worker thread).
 *
 * Design rationale (retraction scope): the original §G1 prereqs proposal
 * had a `HubHostBase = EngineHost<HubAPI>` typedef that `HubHost` itself
 * would derive from.  That OUTER-CONTAINER unification was retracted —
 * hubs are singletons (one binary kind, one config, no dispatch over
 * multiple hub kinds), so there is no polymorphism to abstract over at
 * the HubHost layer; `HubHost` is a single concrete class owning its
 * subsystems directly.  The retraction does NOT touch the inner
 * script-thread runtime: `HubScriptRunner` (Phase 7) derives from
 * `EngineHost<HubAPI>` for code reuse — getting the phase FSM, thread
 * spawn, ready promise, and RAII shutdown machinery.  See HEP-CORE-0033
 * §4 for HubHost layering and §15 Phase 7 for the runner.

// script_host_traits<ApiT> — per-ApiT trait carrier
// ============================================================================
//
// Decouples `EngineHost<ApiT>` from a hardcoded config type so the same
// template body works for the role-side instantiation (`ConfigT =
// RoleConfig`) and for a future hub-side instantiation (`ConfigT =
// HubConfig` — added in HEP-CORE-0033 Phase 7 Commit B alongside the
// `HubAPI` specialization).  Pure compile-time aliasing — substitution
// for `ApiT = RoleAPIBase` produces bit-identical generated code to
// the pre-trait era (verifiable via objdump if needed).
//
// Adding a new ApiT:
//   1. Define ApiT.
//   2. Specialize `script_host_traits<NewApiT>` with its ConfigT.
//   3. Add `template class EngineHost<NewApiT>;` to engine_host.cpp.
//   4. Hub-side specializations live in `hub_script_runner.hpp` (or
//      similar) so engine_host.hpp doesn't need to include hub configs
//      that role-only TUs would never use.
