 * @file shm_capability_channel.hpp
 * @brief Cross-platform SHM capability transport — Layer 1.
 *
 * HEP-CORE-0041 §5-§6 + §9 D1 (Option A) + §10 Phase 1.
 *
 * Two concerns layered, deliberately separated:
 *
 *   - **L1 (this header) — transport mechanics.**  Create an anonymous
 *     shared-memory region; bind a Unix socket / named pipe; accept one
 *     peer; hand the kernel-issued fd / HANDLE to that peer.  Knows
 *     about OS primitives (memfd_create, SCM_RIGHTS, SHM_ANON,
 *     CreateFileMapping, DuplicateHandle).  Knows nothing about CURVE
 *     pubkeys, brokers, or allowlists.
 *
 *   - **L2 (lives elsewhere — see HEP-0041 §9 D4 attach sequence) —
 *     auth orchestration.**  Signed-nonce verification, SO_PEERCRED
 *     sanity check, broker CONSUMER_ATTACH_REQ pre-confirm,
 *     cache-vs-broker divergence WARN.  Uses L1 for the actual fd
 *     handoff but knows nothing about which OS primitive backs the
 *     transport.
 *
 * The split prevents the per-platform backend code (memfd / SHM_ANON /
 * CreateFileMapping) from each having to duplicate the auth flow, and
 * lets the auth orchestration be unit-tested without spinning up real
 * SHM regions.
 *
 * **Platform support today.**  The header surfaces the cross-platform
 * shape (per-platform `AcceptedPeer` variant; per-platform
 * `send_capability` signature).  The implementation file has the
 * full architectural plan for each backend as a detailed comment
 * block, with a `#error` directive that fires at compile time on any
 * target platform without a real implementation.  This prevents
 * shipping a binary that silently does nothing on platforms whose
 * code paths haven't been written yet.
 *
 *   - **Linux:** ✅ Working backend (task #249's `memfd_create` +
 *     `SO_PEERCRED` + `SCM_RIGHTS`).  Production-ready.
 *   - **FreeBSD ≥13.0:** ⛔ `#error` — design plan documented in the
 *     .cpp; implementation tracked under task **#259**.  Near-clone
 *     of the Linux backend with `getpeereid()` swapped in for
 *     `SO_PEERCRED` (FreeBSD's `xucred` carries no PID).
 *   - **macOS:** ⛔ `#error` — design plan documented in the .cpp;
 *     implementation tracked under task **#260**.  macOS lacks
 *     `memfd_create`; the design uses the `shm_open`+`shm_unlink`
 *     trick for anonymous SHM, no `accept4` (so `accept`+`fcntl`),
 *     `getpeereid()` for cred.
 *   - **Windows:** ⛔ `#error` — design plan documented in the .cpp;
 *     implementation tracked under task **#261**.  Different IPC
 *     model entirely: named pipes instead of Unix sockets;
 *     `CreateFileMapping` instead of `memfd_create`; `DuplicateHandle`
 *     instead of `SCM_RIGHTS`.  The `AcceptedPeer` struct uses a
 *     Windows-specific variant (pipe HANDLE + peer PID; no uid/gid
 *     because Windows has no such concept).
 *
 * @see docs/HEP/HEP-CORE-0041-SHM-Channel-Auth.md §5-§6, §9 D1+D4, §10.
 * @see docs/HEP/HEP-CORE-0036-Authenticated-Connection-Establishment.md §1
 *      Amendment 2026-06-16 (the supersession that motivates this module).

/// `SHM_ANON` (deferred), Windows uses `CreateFileMapping(NULL) +

/// **Ownership semantics.**  An instance owns:
///   - The anonymous SHM region's fd / HANDLE.
///   - The bound endpoint (Unix socket / named pipe listener).
///   - The mmap covering `size()` bytes accessible via `data()`.
///
/// Destructor releases all of the above.  Non-copyable + non-movable
/// to keep the kernel-resource ownership unambiguous.
///
/// **Threading.**  The interface itself is single-threaded per
/// instance: `bind_endpoint` → `accept_one` → `send_capability` is a
/// serial flow owned by one thread.  `data()` returns a span that
/// remains valid until destruction; concurrent access to the bytes is
/// the caller's responsibility (the consumer thread sees the same
/// region after fd handoff, and the producer/consumer share a ring
/// buffer protocol on top of `data()` per HEP-CORE-0002).
