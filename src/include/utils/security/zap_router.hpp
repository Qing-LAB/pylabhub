/**
 * @file zap_router.hpp
 * @brief Process-wide ZAP handler — caller-pumped, no internal thread.
 *
 * **Design contract (HEP-CORE-0036 §7.1 + design doc §5.2).**  ZAP
 * (RFC 27) requires one REP socket bound at `inproc://zeromq.zap.01`
 * per `zmq::context_t` to answer libzmq's CURVE-handshake admission
 * RPCs.  This class owns that socket + a `unordered_map<zap_domain,
 * PeerAdmission*>` routing table.  It does NOT own a thread.  The
 * caller pumps `pump_one(timeout)` from an existing event loop —
 * matching the locked HEP's prescription that the handler "runs on
 * the BRC poll thread" (for `plh_role`) or the broker main poll
 * thread (for `plh_hub`).
 *
 * **Lifecycle (HEP-CORE-0001 hybrid model).**  Registered as a
 * persistent dynamic LifecycleManager module on first
 * `register_domain` call.  Startup binds the inproc REP socket.
 * Shutdown closes it.  Persistent flag avoids reload churn across
 * ref_count==0 transitions; module unloads only at LifecycleGuard
 * finalize, in reverse-topo order before ZMQContext teardown.
 *
 * Critically: **startup does not spawn any thread.**  The first cut
 * of this module deadlocked because creating a `ThreadManager` inside
 * the startup callback re-enters `LifecycleManager::register_dynamic_module`
 * from within a locked startup chain — exactly what
 * HEP-CORE-0001's `RecursionGuard` prohibits.  The corrected design
 * has no such re-entrancy because it has no thread to manage.
 *
 * **Threading model.**
 *   - `register_domain` / `unregister_domain_` — any thread; serialized
 *     by `std::shared_mutex` on the routing table.
 *   - `pump_one` — exactly ONE thread per process at a time, enforced
 *     at runtime by the atomic-counter PANIC documented under
 *     "Runtime-enforced invariants" (3) below.  libzmq requires
 *     single-thread access to the inproc REP socket; concurrent
 *     pumpers would silently corrupt its FSM.  Production wires
 *     this on the broker's main poll thread (plh_hub) and the BRC
 *     dispatch thread (plh_role, post-AUTH-2 #162); tests/demos use
 *     `ZapPumpThread` (a tiny RAII helper, defined alongside).
 *
 * **Runtime-enforced invariants (task #215).**  The "exactly ONE
 * pumper" contract and the admission-pointer lifetime are enforced
 * at the call sites, not just documented:
 *
 *   1. `pump_one` holds `registered_mu` in shared mode across the
 *      `admission->is_peer_allowed(...)` call.  `~ZapDomainHandle`
 *      takes the same mutex in unique mode, so the destructor
 *      blocks until any in-flight admission decision completes —
 *      closes the UAF window between the lookup and the call that
 *      fires the moment AUTH-2 (#162) puts pump_one on the BRC
 *      poll thread.
 *   2. `pump_one` pushes a `RecursionGuard` keyed to the router
 *      instance (per `recursion_guard.hpp` — thread-local, RAII).
 *      `register_domain` refuses + logs + returns an inactive handle
 *      when the same thread is already inside an admission decision;
 *      `unregister_domain_` PLH_PANICs (a destructor can't react to
 *      a refusal — leaving a dangling map entry would UAF the next
 *      pump).  See `peer_admission.hpp::is_peer_allowed` reentrance
 *      contract.
 *   3. `pump_one` increments an atomic counter on entry; a second
 *      concurrent entry PLH_PANICs with the post-increment count.
 *      Catches accidental two-pumper configurations (e.g. a
 *      `ZapPumpThread` left in scope while the BRC pump is also
 *      running) before they corrupt the REP socket FSM.
 *
 * **Failure mode — "registered but unpumped" (design §7.4).**  If a
 * binary calls `register_domain` and never pumps, every CURVE
 * handshake on any socket using that `zap_domain` hangs at libzmq.
 * There is NO watchdog.  Prevention is contractual via Phase D
 * integration tests and `ZapPumpThread` RAII for tests/demos.
 *
 * @see HEP-CORE-0001 (lifecycle hybrid model, persistent dynamic
 *      pattern; same shape as `SignalHandler`)
 * @see HEP-CORE-0036 §7.1 (handler runs on BRC poll thread)
 * @see docs/archive/transient-2026-06-02/peer_admission_architecture_design.md §5.2 + §7.2 + §7.4
 * @see RFC 27 (ZAP) — https://rfc.zeromq.org/spec/27/
